      "10861 I've loved every Amazon Basics product I've ordered, this is no exception.  It was important to me that the Fire Stick, Roku and VCR all played correctly on the tv, and this cable along with a switch box, made that happen.\n",
      "10888 So I've had this cable for a few years now and it's held up very well. It's one of those things you only notice if it fails... and I never think about it, so I think it desers 5 stars.\n",

      "15110 These HDMI cables are strong and durable.  The endings are made to last, and the cable itself will not break easily.  I have not noticed any connectivity issues.  These cables come in various lengths, such as 6.5 feet, that you can purchase and use depending on your needs.<br /><br />HDMI, or High-Definition Multimedia Interface, is the standard for audio and video.  It is used universally with televisions, computer monitors, and gaming systems.  It is also capable of transmitting 4K video, as well as high quality audio.  These cables do just that in a reliable way.  The endings are gold-plated to ensure reliable connectivity, and the cord itself is built to last.<br /><br />These cables are very tough and durable. Most cheaper cables either form a break in the connection, or the end interface forms a break, within a few months. However, I have never had any problems with these cables.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who needs a high quality, durable HDMI cable.\n",

It has held up very well after being transported between PS3/PS4, blu-ray players, XBOX 360 and more. The thick rope seems very durable and not easy chewed through by my cats who are fond of cords.

      "57598 High priced 'boutique' HDMI cables are one of the biggest scams out there and paying more doesn't necessarily get you more. In fact, in the case of HDMI cables, hardly ever!<br />(go to your local 'red bullseye' store and see the outrageous prices for what should be a low priced item)<br /><br />I have a medium to large sized setup with all my devices (Blu Ray, HD DVD, SACD , HD DVR and HDTV interconnected by HDMI cables. Bottom line for a good cable is simple. Either it works, or it doesn't. Well, that used to be the rule of thumb until 3D HDTV. Now it is important to have what is known as a 'High Speed&#34; cable , one that can handle the higher data transmission rate of the 3D video signal.<br /><br />These Amazon Basic cables fit the bill nicely. Plenty long enough for most any needs at 6ft and a pair of them at that for the price of less than one higher priced brand. I am impressed by the workmanship (albeit by machines I would think) of the actual connectors themselves and also the sturdy feeling, yet pliable cabling.<br /><br />This is not to say that you can't have problems with HDMI cables and usually the problems are with the pins in the connectors themselves. Overuse of the cables (plugging and unplugging many times) can wear out the pins and keep the connectors from making an overall tight fit. My advice is to connect them the least possible times necessary to get your setup up and running. And that advice applies to pretty much any brand, not just lower priced cables.<br /><br />Hey, cables are not sexy like a brand new Blu Ray Player or 3D HDTV but they are in integral part of your setup and you need them to be both functional, reliable and hopefully inexpensive. I truly believe these Amazon cables deliver on all three points and can totally recommend them for anyone needing high speed HDMI cabling.<br /><br />As my review title states, I feel these Amazon Basics are as good as my slightly higher priced Mono Price cables which many AV web groups swear by. Hopefully you will have a good experience with them too. I sure have so far!by. Hopefully you will have a good experience with them too. I sure have so far!\n",

      "71975 Handles Your Audio & Video Entertainment Needs At A Great Price!<br /><br />I was speaking to a friend about cables needed for my Panasonic Home Theater System so that I can have clarity in audio and video to watch DVD movies, and play music CDs. He decided to send me a gift of Amazon Basics High-Speed Cable 6.5 feet which allows for room to connect and move around with all the other wires that are connected to my technology system for my entertainment needs.<br /><br />It is amazing, when people need cables for their technology needs it is surprising how expensive these cables are sold in various stores/retailers.  As people want to use cables to become connected quickly, they sometimes make decisions to purchase these cables, although they are no happy about the prices they have to spend to have a connection.  Unfortunately, it places people in the position of paying higher prices for cables that they could have purchased at a more reasonable price. Of course, these cables are great for all technology needs; gaming, pc, laptop, tablets, entertainment systems, as well as other devices. The Seller has described these High-Speed HDMI Cables accurately, and they are definitely great for the purposes they are advertised for to enjoy audio and video technology needs and entertainment.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to others, as well as Amazon Customers. They were packed neatly in an envelope and secure. Delivery was timely. Thanks Amazon for a great product, at a very reasonable price.\n",

      "89415 I made the mistake of buying a Monster cable at one point. And while I do still have the Monster cable because of their lifetime warranty, I've now had to return the cable to Monster two times because of various failures in the product. While I was waiting for my Monster cable to be replaced, I decided to buy one of these AmazonBasics HDMI cables to use in the interim.  I've been using the cable for about seven months and it's been everything I could have hoped for and more. The quality is solid. I've used it with my PS3, with regular TV and also as the cable connecting my laptop and external monitor. And it has performed well in all of those conditions. The one thing I hate about it is that it serves as a constant reminder that I spent 10x more for a Monster cable that I've returned twice and I feel like an idiot.\n",

It made my dumb old TV turn into a &#34;smart&#34; TV. The picture was great. A week down the road the picture started cutting out every 5 minutes and I would have to get up to readjust the cord. It turns out the cord does not like to be bent at all. I was getting ready to send my bluray player back because i thought that was the problem, it turns out it was just the cord. Switched the cord out for a more expensive one, and everything works perfectly now.\n",

Stay away from this product on top of it not working I am having a very hard time getting a  warrantee replacement, I have lost all my faith in Yamaha a brand that I liked very much over the years.  I am very sorry that I can't get my amplifier fixed or replaced so stay away from Yamaha products.\n",

      "180993 ok\n",
      "181124 Just what we needed\n",
      "181203 I have used this connecting my monitor with a laptop. It works perfectly, and seems much better built than other HDMI chords. Perfect chord, and the 6.5ft length helps me a whole lot.<br />There is absolutely nothing better anywhere: electronic stores, online shops, eBay or Amazon. There is no better price anywhere.\n",
      "181339 Works great. I use it to connect my cable box to my TV\n",
      "181458 Its a good wire and incredibly cheap.\n",
      "182197 The cable is doing a fantastic job so far on my TV. No complaints at all.....\n",
      "182281 works great.\n",
      "182525 This cable has outperformed ones that come with high end systems, but for a fraction of the price. Very sturdy with a heavy duty feel. Never had any problems with the picture blacking out or the cable becoming loosened or disconnected from poor manufacturing. Very pleased with this cable. Had over 2 years. Highly recommended.\n",
      "183123 Works as designed and cheap, no complaints.\n",

      "184502 This is such a fantastic product. It works flawlessly and I get a great picture with it on my TV. I was surprised when I was at Best Buy looking for a TV and this same exact kind of cable, shorter too if I recall, was going for over $20. Why would anyone pay that much for a cable that is not even 6 ft long? And I believe that was the cheapest one! Checked here and was not disappointed. The reviews people left were spot on. The price can't be beat and the quality is great!\n",
      "184709 Good cable, good price\n",
      "184931 Great product!\n",
      "185119 Works very well, and just as good as more expensive cables. The only issue I've had is an odd problem with it not sitting quite right in the HDMI slot of my laptop, causing it to wobble, sometimes causing minor problems. That's probably an issue with the port of my laptop, and not the cable, though.\n",
      "185150 Can't beat the price!  Does exactly what I need.  Great picture and sound!  I purchased multiple just to have just in case.\n",

      "187408 Perform well and I like the gold plated contacts for less oxidation problems\n",
      "187512 This HDMI cable works perfectly to connect my Playstation 4 to my TV, I have used it with other devices on other TVs as well without an issue.  Other brands jack up the prices of HDMI cables with no added benefit, just get this one and you'll be set!\n",

      "192956 Fast delivery, great quality product. My Xbox had stopped working and I read that the smart tv update changed the HDMI cable requirement from any to 1.4. I noticed the old one was just plain. I ordered this and voala, My Xbox works great again in my Samsung smart tv. The 1.4 or specific info is located along the cable itself.\n",
      "193069 It's an HDMI cable that makes your HD stuff work like HD should. What's more to say?\n",
      "193075 Works well, but I don't think it's that much different than the cheaper ones.  The look and feel are of the more expensive cords.\n",
      "193154 Plastic end coverings get in the way for a lot of my devices. I've had to trim them down with razor blades.\n",

The only thing I'd think about next time I buy a HDMI cable is I would go for a longer cable as it doesn't allow for much extra room once it's run up the wall into the tv. I got the 6.5 foot cable. If you have a far space (your tv is mounted on the wall and your device is in a cabinet) then I'd suggest going up a few feet for your cable, otherwise this cable works great and I'd highly recommend it.\n",

Since my TV is mounted up high on the wall it is great to have this longer cable to be able to reach somewhere that I can sit the iPad since there is no where next to the TV that I can do that. This really is a high quality cable that I couldn't do without.\n",

Be advised that everything you need comes in the package with the antenna and that the HDMI cable in unnecessary. In addition, it is difficult to see how this cable could be of any use with the antenna. As the cable costs about $5.00 and the return charges are $7.00, I have one more extra cable. Live and learn!\n",
